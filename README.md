# Full-Data-Science-Project-with-Flask
A complete data science project that includes data preprocessing, model training using scikit-learn, and deployment using Flask. The API accepts user input (e.g., Titanic passenger details) and returns predictions on survival. Demonstrates end-to-end workflow from data to deployed ML model through a simple, interactive web service.
